# Project GitHub Setup Summary

## What has been done:

1. ✅ Initialized Git repository
2. ✅ Created README.md with basic project structure
3. ✅ Created .gitignore file with common exclusions for Python projects
4. ✅ Configured local Git user identity (repository-specific)
5. ✅ Made initial commit with project files
6. ✅ Created detailed instructions for connecting to GitHub

## What you need to do next:

1. Follow the steps in GITHUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md to:
   - Push your local commits to the existing GitHub repository at:
     https://github.com/elreynolds88/CMS.git

## Repository Status:

The repository now contains:
- LICENSE file (original)
- README.md (new)
- .gitignore (new)
- GITHUB_INSTRUCTIONS.md (new)

All files are committed and ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## Git Configuration:

Local repository-specific Git configuration has been set up with:

- User name: Project User

You may want to update these with your actual information using:
```
git config user.email "your.actual.email@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Actual Name"
```
