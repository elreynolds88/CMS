# Instructions for Pushing to GitHub

Your local Git repository is already connected to GitHub at:
https://github.com/elreynolds88/CMS.git

## Push your local changes to GitHub

Since your repository is already connected to GitHub, you just need to push your local commits:

```bash
# Push your local commits to GitHub
git push origin main
```

If you're prompted for credentials, you'll need to provide your GitHub username and either your password or a personal access token (recommended).

## 3. Verify the push

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files (LICENSE, README.md, .gitignore) in the repository

## 4. Future pushes

For future changes, use the following workflow:

```bash
# Make changes to your files

# Add the changes to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push
```

## Note on authentication

If this is your first time using GitHub from the command line, you might need to authenticate. GitHub now uses personal access tokens instead of passwords for command line authentication:

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with appropriate permissions
3. Use this token when prompted for a password

Alternatively, you can set up SSH authentication for more secure and convenient access.
